# The-Gatekeeper

This is a personal project I began in order to test the visual novel game engine Ren'Py. 
The files of note that were written by me are "characters.rpy" and "script.rpy". The remaining files were automatically written by Ren'Py when I began and exported my project.
Path to reach files: (Start by opening Windows + Linux or Mac distribution folder) -> game

During this project, I practiced the process of creating sprites with multiple expressions and then manipulating their size within the code. Further, I experimented with branching endings, creating a variable which tracked "friendship points" that were ultimately tallied at the end of the game to indicate which ending the player obtained. 

The project code could be further optimized, perhaps with separate .rpy files to define the friendship point mechanic and hold the code for the branching endings. Since the game is ultimately incredibly short and limited in scope, these changes aren't necessary. In the future, I can anticipate using separate files in order to keep the code clean and manageable.
